This module introduces a new DevelGenerate plugin called "LandingPage".

Once enabled, you can see a new option in /admin/config/development/generate/ called "Generate Landing page", or directly visit it from /admin/config/development/generate/landing-page

There are 4 possible options:
1. The number of nodes of type "landing_page" that should be generated
2. Optional prefix in the node title for the generated nodes
3. Checkbox to select if it should use all enabled paragraphs in field_components
4. Checkbox to delete all nodes of type landing_page before generation.
